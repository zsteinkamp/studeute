<em>""Hi Dick,</em>

I have a neat surprise for you.

I am working on the 60th Anniversary currently, and we are going to attempt to recreate the building that your car was in back in 59!

I would love to see you and the car there. The plan is to have 10 50's cars from the show in the front of the building and then timeline back to current in the back of the building.

We are going to recreate the overhead signs as well as try to locate some old standard oil barrels to place around the vehicles.

We will use Bld 9 that we used for the 75th anniversary of the 32 ford 2 years ago.

All of the cars in this room will be historic vehicles and I would love to see you and your Studebaker there.

Please send me you mailing address so I can get you more details.

<span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>(did I say I was stoked? !!)</strong></span>

Jon Falcon has agreed to do the body and paint for me. He's my young buddy and WyoTech grad that has about 4 years in a restoration shop and did the '63 Hawk for me last year. He's now at Western Washington University here in Bellingham in their Industrial Design program, but has the summer off.

It will have a '55 President 259 with 2 backdraft Stromberg 2 barrels and some Offenhauser aluminum dress up stuff. 3 speed OD with a Jeep floor shifter. (engine and trans courtesy of Gord Richmond)

I need a vintage go Kart for the bed as it was exhibited at the '59 ORS.

It was Pink at the '59 ORS, but I can't do pink. Need some color suggestions.

Just received this from the Producer of the Grand National Roadster Show...

<em>""Hi Dick,

I have a neat surprise for you.

I am working on the 60th Anniversary currently, and we are going to attempt to recreate the building that your car was in back in 59!

I would love to see you and the car there. The plan is to have 10 50�s cars from the show in the front of the building and then timeline back to current in the back of the building.

We are going to recreate the overhead signs as well as try to locate some old standard oil barrels to place around the vehicles.

We will use Bld 9 that we used for the 75th anniversary of the 32 ford 2 years ago.

All of the cars in this room will be historic vehicles and I would love to see you and your Studebaker there.

Please send me you mailing address so I can get you more details.

John Buck ""</em>

Jon Falcon has agreed to do the body and paint for me. He's my young buddy and WyoTech grad that has about 4 years in a restoration shop and did the '63 Hawk for me last year. He's now at Western Washington University here in Bellingham in their Industrial Design program, but has the summer off.

It will have a '55 President 259 with 2 backdraft Stromberg 2 barrels and some Offenhauser aluminum dress up stuff. 3 speed OD with a Jeep floor shifter. (engine and trans courtesy of Gord Richmond)

I need a vintage go Kart for the bed as it was exhibited at the '59 ORS.

It was Pink at the '59 ORS, but I can't do pink.  Need some color suggestions.

I checked my voice mail at my home phone yesterday and there was a message from Chris Talbot. Chris explained that his father, Lee Talbot, and his partner Sam Chakries are the ones that originally built the Ute for the '59 Oakland Roadster Show.

I called Chris back. He explained that they had seen the article in Hot Rod Deluxe on the car and that his Dad is STOKED that his old custom has surfaced. He gave me his Dad's phone number. Lee is 80 and lives in Astoria, OR.

I gave Lee a call today. What a great guy! Sharp as a tack. A real car guy through and through. He has built many cars and recently repurchased the 28 Ford hot rod he owned when he was in the army 55 years ago!

Lee has pictures of the Ute when it was under construction and some at the ORS. We will meet in Olympia, WA mid July so I can get copies of all the pictures and hear all the stories.

Lee is super excited that the car will be in the Grand National Roadster Show for the 50th anniversary of its appearance in the predecessor of that show.

He told me that Sam Chakries still lives in Livermore and would also be excited to talk with me.

Neat deal

He is really stoked that the car will be at the GNRS in January of 2009 for it's 50th anniversary appearance, and plans to attend.

He is really stoked that the car will be at the GNRS in January of 2009 for it's 50th anniversary appearance, and plans to attend.

Lee gave me copies of 15 pictures of the car under construction and completed.  Here they are for any one that is interested...

Lee is 80 years old and now lives in Astoria, OR. He was up visiting his brother in Olympia, WA today, so I made the 2 1/2 hour drive to Olympia to meet Lee personally.

What a great guy! Friendly, sincere, interesting, lively. He's been a ""gear head"" since the early 40's when he built his first hot rod...a '28 Ford roadster with a Riley 4 port head. He bought that car back 20 years ago and still has it. Lee has built many many customs and hot rods. He is one of those few people with artistic talent and fabrication skills. He has also raced cars at Bonneville and the dry lakes and been heavily involved in boat racing. He still campaigns a 392 Chrysler powered flat bottom drag boat.

Here is Lee and his wife Judy at lunch today...

It's a little strange that BOTH were twisted since the car has an open rear end (factory 4.56/1).

Although Lee had a Supercharged Golden Hawk engine in the car, I don't think it would have done this kind of damage to the axles. When I got the car, it had indications that a brand x engine was installed sometime after Lee sold it. It must have been a little TOO big OR someone had sidestepped the clutch at 4,000 RPMs too often.

I thought I had rounded up all the clutch linkage parts, but ran into two problems.

The trans is not drilled and tapped for the bolts that would either mount the trans in a car that didn't mount off the bell housing, or (for our Studes) would mount the bracket that holds the clutch operating cross shaft. I've not seen one like this, but there must have been SOME Studebaker application that did not need these holes drilled and tapped

<a href=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/clutch-002.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-402"" src=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/clutch-002-600x450.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""450"" /></a>

I figured I would drill and tap those holes once the engine and trans were installed so I could mock up the clutch linkage in position to insure I got the holes in the right location.

The second problem is that the bracket that bolts to the trans and holds the cross shaft is too short from where it bolts to the trans to where the ball socket for the cross shaft fits into it. I'm guessing I got one for a sedan and need one for a C/K...

<a href=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/clutch-001.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-404"" src=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/clutch-001-600x450.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""450"" /></a>

Bottom line is that I need the correct cross shaft bracket (I BELIEVE that is all I need, but I've been wrong before...three times already today)

Does anybody have one for sale?

Twice in a Lifetime will take us all back in history to the classic roadster show with a recreation of the old GNRS buildings highlighted by vehicles from the 1950s to the 2000s.

We will showcase award winning hot rods, customs, bikes, trucks and classics that will offer a unique look at the transition of show vehicle trends over the decades. We think your vehicle best represents the look and style that we want to showcase at this years Grand National Roadster Show.

As one of the 60 invited vehicle owners you will be our guest for the weekend. You will receive Show credentials (2 set up day passes, 2 three day passes, and a weekend parking pass and the show gift package), a commemorative commissioned Dave Bell 60th anniversary poster, and a one of a kind Suede Jacket with the 60th Anniversary Logo embroidered on the back (see logo above) and your name and the first year in the GNRS embroidered on it.

Brian Curtis came over yesterday and we bled the brakes, found and fixed all the leaks, installed the emergency brake system, throttle linkage, drive shaft, loosely put the front sheet metal together and maybe 10 other things. It helps to have another pair of hands...especially an expert pair like Brian's.

It's looking more like a car...

The green top part ties in exactly to the painted sill on the doors.

I pulled the front springs out and just put a 2 x 4 between the lower A arm and the upper spring pocket. Now it sits approximately right (temporarily).

I also tossed the wheels and tires that were on it and put on some 205 75 15's on 4 1/2"" Lark wheels temporarily. At least they fit under the car <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile.gif"" border=""0"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" />.

The car is sits right now (front vs rear height), but is still about 2"" too high all the way around (IMHO). The rear tires need to get into the top of the wheel well. It will end up with taller bias ply tires than the 205 75's (and wide whites of course), but the rear end still needs to come down some. Easy with some generic lowering blocks. The front will have smaller tires than are what are on it now which will help to keep the 2"" drop front to rear, but will probably need to be a tad lower on the springs also.

It's much more fun working on a car that at least looks semi right <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_approve.gif"" border=""0"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" />.

I pulled the front springs out and just put a 2 x 4 between the lower A arm and the upper spring pocket. Now it sits approximately right (temporarily).

I also tossed the wheels and tires that were on it and put on some 205 75 15's on 4 1/2"" Lark wheels temporarily. At least they fit under the car <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile.gif"" border=""0"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" />.

The car is sits right now (front vs rear height), but is still about 2"" too high all the way around (IMHO). The rear tires need to get into the top of the wheel well. It will end up with taller bias ply tires than the 205 75's (and wide whites of course), but the rear end still needs to come down some. Easy with some generic lowering blocks. The front will have smaller tires than are what are on it now which will help to keep the 2"" drop front to rear, but will probably need to be a tad lower on the springs also.

It's much more fun working on a car that at least looks semi right <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_approve.gif"" border=""0"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" />.

I haven't really caught up on the forum yet, so if I duplicate some info or pictures here, I apologize.

It was a FANTASTIC 5 days for a car guy . My only regret is that I didn't get to meet everyone from the forum that attended the show and didn't get to spend enough time with those I was fortunate enough to bump into. 

I'd have to say that the Ute was well received. It was quite an honor to be staged alongside such milestone cars as Ala Kart, the Sam Barris Mercury, the Glass Slipper, Blackie's 1955 AMBR winning roadster, Roth's Outlaw, Tommy Ivo's nailhead powered roadster, and a host of other cars I only dreamed of SEEING in person...let alone PARKED NEXT TO . The Ute drew as big or bigger crowds than any of the above. 

I got to the FairPlex Wednesday afternoon, dropped the trailer and picked up Brian Curtis (TW Custom and Modified Editor) at the airport. Brian and I unloaded the car and found our assigned slot. I don't think I was much help. I mainly just stood there with my mouth open checking out the top hot rods and customs from the 50's that surrounded the Ute...







Thursday morning, I picked Jon up at the airport and got him and Brian busy detailing the car while I did ""important"" stuff ...



By noon, we were done...



...and spent the rest of the day looking at the 600 or so BEAUTIFUL cars there. Oddly enough there was only one other Studebaker...a modified Avanti. There were a few more that showed up for the outdoor show on Saturday and Sunday, however.

There were a couple of very nice Studebaker powered cars, however. This one won the Jalopy Journal award as voted on by the members of the H.A.M.B. forum. It was one of my favorites too...






Here's a few more...











I toured the NHRA museum on Saturday. What a great collection of hot rod history . Here's the Gale Banks Stude...





The Cad powered, dark blue Model A coupe that was featured in Rod and Custom several months back was there. The Cad motor in this car was the inspiration for how we ended up doing the motor in the Ute...




This one has nothing to do with Studebakers, but I took it for Keoni. I know he wanted to be there...



One of the high points was getting to spend some time with Lee Talbot...the original builder of the car in 1958. Lee is just fun to be around . He's got more energy, more car stories, more smiles, than I'll EVER have. He was there with car buddes and his son, daughter, and the grandson that has Lee's hot rod '29 Ford that Lee built in the 40's. On Sunday, Hot Rod Deluxe wanted to interview Lee and take some pictures of him with the car. Just about the time we were finishing that process, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and the story...



That's Lee and me on the right and Jerry Pitt, editor of Hot Rod Deluxe doing the talking.

Here's another shot...




Sunday night is generally a gong show as 600 cars try to get into their trailers at the same time . Jerry Pitt arranged for a special staging area for our trailer behind the NHRA museum which made the process easier for us. Monday AM, I met Jerry and the photographer at his hotel and followed them to Billy Walden's Speed Shop where the pictures would be taken. BTW, the photographer was Wes Allison who is one of today's most famous automobile photographers. There probably is not an issue of any major car magazine that doesn't have some of Wes' pictures in it. Wes also works for the major car companies. He is on his way to Detroit today to do a shoot of a concept car for GM. Great guy . Here's few pictures from the shoot...







Wes explained to me that the background is interesting, but ""busy"". For the magazine, he will change the background to black and white so the car stands out in color. Here's a shot I took right after he took the same one.



Coincidentally, Robert Iannello from www.benchrace.com was at Billy's shop when we pulled in. He had been trying to find me at the GNRS to get permission to also shoot the car. Generally, car magazines want an exclusive. For example, Rod and Custom also wanted to shoot the Ute (thanks to Kevin from our forum ), but I had to turn them down since HRD has been so good to me from the start. Rod and Custom and HRD BOTH ran Orbitron this month and they were not very happy about it . Anyway, Jerry didn't feel that benchrace was direct competition and felt it was OK. 

After the 3 hour shoot at Billy's place, Robert and I took the car into the industrial part of Pomona and took some more pictures. They will look something like this on benchrace...







I got out of Pomona about 3 PM...over the snow covered grapevine just out of LA , hooked up with Mr. Biggs for a few minutes (too few), and back to San Jose about midnight.


A great car experience for sure! Thanks to all on the Forum that helped make it so. I took over 300 pictures, so I'm sure to bore the group with more when I get home and have some time.";"GNRS";0;"";"draft";"open";"open";"";"";"";"";"2009-01-27 20:03:26";"2009-01-28 04:03:26";"";0;"http://www.studeute.com/?p=231";0;"post";"";0

On Sunday, Hot Rod Deluxe wanted to interview Lee and take some pictures of him with the car. Just about the time we were finishing that process, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and the story...

That's Lee and me on the right and Jerry Pitt, editor of Hot Rod Deluxe doing the talking.

Here's another shot...

Sunday night is generally a gong show as 600 cars try to get into their trailers at the same time. Jerry Pitt arranged for a special staging area for our trailer behind the NHRA museum which made the process easier for us. Monday AM, I met Jerry and the photographer at his hotel and followed them to Bobby Walden's Speed Shop where the pictures would be taken. BTW, the photographer was Wes Allison who is one of today's most famous automobile photographers. There probably is not an issue of any major car magazine that doesn't have some of Wes' pictures in it. Wes also works for the major car companies. He is on his way to Detroit today to do a shoot of a concept car for GM. Great guy. Here's few pictures from the shoot...

Wes explained to me that the background is interesting, but ""busy"". For the magazine, he will change the background to black and white so the car stands out in color. Here's a shot I took right after he took the same one.

Coincidentally, Robert Iannello from <a href=""http://www.benchrace.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">www.benchrace.com</a> was at Bobby's shop when we pulled in. He had been trying to find me at the GNRS to get permission to also shoot the car. Generally, car magazines want an exclusive. For example, Rod and Custom also wanted to shoot the Ute (thanks to Kevin from the SDC forum, but I had to turn them down since HRD has been so good to me from the start. Rod and Custom and HRD BOTH ran Orbitron this month and they were not very happy about it. Anyway, Jerry didn't feel that benchrace was direct competition and felt it was OK.

After the 3 hour shoot at Bobby's place, Robert and I took the car into the industrial part of Pomona and took some more pictures. They will look something like this on benchrace...

I got out of Pomona about 3 PM...over the snow covered grapevine just out of LA, hooked up with Mr. Biggs for a few minutes (too few), and back to San Jose about midnight.

A great car experience for sure! Thanks to all on the SDC Forum that helped make it so. I took over 300 pictures, so I'm sure to bore the group with more when I get home and have some time.";"GNRS";0;"";"publish";"open";"open";"";"gnrs";"";"";"2017-11-26 13:36:53";"2017-11-26 21:36:53";"";0;"http://www.studeute.com/?p=232";0;"post";"";0

A couple of weeks ago, I started into wiring it, getting it running, and working out some bugs. The biggest issue was that dummy me had put the clutch disc in backwards <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_sad.gif"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" border=""0"" />. A real rookie mistake.

It is now running good enough and driving good enough that Brian Curtis and I took it out for a photo shoot in several different locations.

It was a FANTASTIC 5 days for a car guy. My only regret is that I didn't get to meet everyone from the SDC Forum that attended the show and didn't get to spend enough time with those I was fortunate enough to bump into.

I'd have to say that the Ute was well received. It was quite an honor to be staged alongside such milestone cars as Ala Kart, the Sam Barris Mercury, the Glass Slipper, Blackie's 1955 AMBR winning roadster, Roth's Outlaw, Tommy Ivo's nailhead powered roadster, and a host of other cars I only dreamed of SEEING in person...let alone PARKED NEXT TO. The Ute drew as big or bigger crowds than any of the above.

I got to the FairPlex Wednesday afternoon, dropped the trailer and picked up Brian Curtis (TW Custom and Modified Editor) at the airport. Brian and I unloaded the car and found our assigned slot. I don't think I was much help. I mainly just stood there with my mouth open checking out the top hot rods and customs from the 50's that surrounded the Ute...

...and spent the rest of the day looking at the 600 or so BEAUTIFUL cars there. Oddly enough there was only one other Studebaker...a modified Avanti. There were a few more that showed up for the outdoor show on Saturday and Sunday, however.

There were a couple of very nice Studebaker powered cars, however. This one won the Jalopy Journal award as voted on by the members of the H.A.M.B. forum. It was one of my favorites too...

The Cad powered, dark blue Model A coupe that was featured in Rod and Custom several months back was there. The Cad motor in this car was the inspiration for how we ended up doing the motor in the Ute...

This one has nothing to do with Studebakers, but I took it for Keoni. I know he wanted to be there...

One of the high points was getting to spend some time with Lee Talbot...the original builder of the car in 1958. Lee is just fun to be around. He's got more energy, more car stories, more smiles, than I'll EVER have. He was there with car buddes and his son, daughter, and the grandson that has Lee's hot rod '29 Ford that Lee built in the 40's. On Sunday, Hot Rod Deluxe wanted to interview Lee and take some pictures of him with the car. Just about the time we were finishing that process, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and the story...

<a href=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/IMG_2346.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-331"" src=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/IMG_2346-600x450.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""450"" /></a>

That's Lee and me on the right and Jerry Pitt, editor of Hot Rod Deluxe doing the talking.

Here's another shot...

Sunday night is generally a gong show as 600 cars try to get into their trailers at the same time. Jerry Pitt arranged for a special staging area for our trailer behind the NHRA museum which made the process easier for us. Monday AM, I met Jerry and the photographer at his hotel and followed them to Bobby Walden's Speed Shop where the pictures would be taken. BTW, the photographer was Wes Allison who is one of today's most famous automobile photographers. There probably is not an issue of any major car magazine that doesn't have some of Wes' pictures in it. Wes also works for the major car companies. He is on his way to Detroit today to do a shoot of a concept car for GM. Great guy. Here's few pictures from the shoot...

Wes explained to me that the background is interesting, but ""busy"". For the magazine, he will change the background to black and white so the car stands out in color. Here's a shot I took right after he took the same one.

Coincidentally, Robert Iannello from <a href=""http://www.benchrace.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">www.benchrace.com</a> was at Bobby's shop when we pulled in. He had been trying to find me at the GNRS to get permission to also shoot the car. Generally, car magazines want an exclusive. For example, Rod and Custom also wanted to shoot the Ute (thanks to Kevin from the SDC forum, but I had to turn them down since HRD has been so good to me from the start. Rod and Custom and HRD BOTH ran Orbitron this month and they were not very happy about it. Anyway, Jerry didn't feel that benchrace was direct competition and felt it was OK.

After the 3 hour shoot at Bobby's place, Robert and I took the car into the industrial part of Pomona and took some more pictures. They will look something like this on benchrace...

I got out of Pomona about 3 PM...over the snow covered grapevine just out of LA, hooked up with Mr. Biggs for a few minutes (too few), and back to San Jose about midnight.

A great car experience for sure! Thanks to all on the SDC Forum that helped make it so. I took over 300 pictures, so I'm sure to bore the group with more when I get home and have some time.";"GNRS";0;"";"inherit";"closed";"closed";"";"232-autosave-v1";"";"";"2017-11-26 13:36:38";"2017-11-26 21:36:38";"";232;"http://studeute.steinkamp.us/2017/11/25/232-autosave-v1/";0;"revision";"";0

It's a Dart ""A-bone"" with two West Bend 820's. Race ready.

I'll probably end up blowing it apart and painting the chassis the same color as the Ute (WHATEVER that turns out to be <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile.gif"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" border=""0"" />)

I'd have to say that the Ute was well received. It was quite an honor to be staged alongside such milestone cars as Ala Kart, the Sam Barris Mercury, the Glass Slipper, Blackie's 1955 AMBR winning roadster, Roth's Outlaw, Tommy Ivo's nailhead powered roadster, and a host of other cars I only dreamed of SEEING in person...let alone PARKED NEXT TO <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_cool.gif"" border=""0"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" />. The Ute drew as big or bigger crowds than any of the above. 

I got to the FairPlex Wednesday afternoon, dropped the trailer and picked up Brian Curtis (TW Custom and Modified Editor) at the airport. Brian and I unloaded the car and found our assigned slot. I don't think I was much help. I mainly just stood there with my mouth open checking out the top hot rods and customs from the 50's that surrounded the Ute...

There were a couple of very nice Studebaker powered cars, however. This one won the Jalopy Journal award as voted on by the members of the H.A.M.B. forum. It was one of my favorites too...

Coincidentally, Robert Iannello from <a href=""http://www.benchrace.com/"" target=""_blank"">www.benchrace.com</a> was at Billy's shop when we pulled in. He had been trying to find me at the GNRS to get permission to also shoot the car. Generally, car magazines want an exclusive.

Anyway, Jerry didn't feel that benchrace was direct competition and felt it was OK. 

After the 3 hour shoot at Billy's place, Robert and I took the car into the industrial part of Pomona and took some more pictures. They will look something like this on benchrace...

My only regret is that I didn't get to meet everyone from the SDC Forum that attended the show and didn't get to spend enough time with those I was fortunate enough to bump into.

I'd have to say that the Ute was well received. It was quite an honor to be staged alongside such milestone cars as Ala Kart, the Sam Barris Mercury, the Glass Slipper, Blackie's 1955 AMBR winning roadster, Roth's Outlaw, Tommy Ivo's nailhead powered roadster, and a host of other cars I only dreamed of SEEING in person...let alone PARKED NEXT TO <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_cool.gif"" border=""0"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" />. The Ute drew as big or bigger crowds than any of the above.

I got to the FairPlex Wednesday afternoon, dropped the trailer and picked up Brian Curtis (TW Custom and Modified Editor) at the airport. Brian and I unloaded the car and found our assigned slot. I don't think I was much help. I mainly just stood there with my mouth open checking out the top hot rods and customs from the 50's that surrounded the Ute...

...and spent the rest of the day looking at the 600 or so BEAUTIFUL cars there. Oddly enough there was only one other Studebaker...a modified Avanti. There were a few more that showed up for the outdoor show on Saturday and Sunday, however.

There were a couple of very nice Studebaker powered cars, however. This one won the Jalopy Journal award as voted on by the members of the H.A.M.B. forum. It was one of my favorites too...

<br><br>
In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it. 
<br><br>
The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.
<br><br>
It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense. 
<br><br>
A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story. 
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years. 
<br><br>
What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January. 
<br><br>
I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen. 
<br><br>
I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Sunday, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and on Lee Talbot (who flew down for the show).  
<br><br>

<br><br>
On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<b><font size=6>Body, Paint and Chassis</b></font size=6>
<br>
Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.  
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics036.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

<br><br>
<b><font size=6>Engine and Drive Train</b></font size=6>
<br>
The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.   
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.  
<br><br>
The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set. 
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/under003.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.
<br><br>
Here is a short video of the car in motion -

<a href= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPTf5Ir7iPg >KART HAULER VIDEO</a></center></b><font size=5>
<br><br>
In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.  
<br><br>
Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=http://www.vintagekarts.com/>Vintage Karts</a> and <a href=http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka/>Vintage Karting Association</a> with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.
<br><br>
Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.  
<br><br>
It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.  
<br><br>
It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.  
<br><br>
Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.
<br><br>
When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/kart014.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.  
<br><br>
Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.
<br><br>
It is a <b>Show Car</b>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

<br><br>
In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it. 
<br><br>
The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.
<br><br>
It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense. 
<br><br>
A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story. 
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years. 
<br><br>
What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration. 
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics10.jpg"">&nbsp<img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics14.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January. 
<br><br>
I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen. 
<br><br>
I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Sunday, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and on Lee Talbot (who flew down for the show).  
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics181.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<br><br>
<b><font size=6>Body, Paint and Chassis</b></font size=6>
<br>
Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.  
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics036.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.
<br><br>

<br><br>
I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.  
<br><br>

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<b><font size=6>Engine and Drive Train</b></font size=6>
<br>
The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.   
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.  
<br><br>
The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set. 
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/under003.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.
<br><br>
Here is a short video of the car in motion -

<br><br>
In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.  
<br><br>
Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=http://www.vintagekarts.com/>Vintage Karts</a> and <a href=http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka/>Vintage Karting Association</a> with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.
<br><br>
Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.  
<br><br>
It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.  
<br><br>
It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.  
<br><br>
Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.
<br><br>
When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/kart014.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Sunday, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and on Lee Talbot (who flew down for the show).

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics181.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics214.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics036.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics209.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Interior</span></strong>

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics023.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics017.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

The stainless steel strips in the bed carry through to the package shelf in the interior.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics021.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/ebay003.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/under003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Here is a short video of the car in motion -</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">The Kart
</span></strong>

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img class=""aligncenter"" src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span></p>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites Vintage Karts and Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/kart014.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>
The restoration of this car is fully documented on my blog here -</strong></span>

<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>

Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

</span></strong>

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites Vintage Karts and Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

<br><br>
In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it. 
<br><br>
The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.
<br><br>
It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense. 
<br><br>
A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years. 
<br><br>
What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

<br><br>
I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January. 
<br><br>
I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen. 
<br><br>
I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

<b><font size=6>Body, Paint and Chassis</b></font size=6>
<br>
Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.  
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg""></center>
<br><br>
When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.
<br><br>

<br><br>
All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.
<br><br>
<center><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics036.jpg""></center>

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.  
<br><br>
It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.  
<br><br>
It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.  
<br><br>
Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.
<br><br>
When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.
<br><br>
It is a <b>Show Car</b>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics10.jpg"" alt="""" /> <img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics14.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Sunday, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and on Lee Talbot (who flew down for the show).

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics181.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics214.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics036.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics209.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics023.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics017.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

The stainless steel strips in the bed carry through to the package shelf in the interior.

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics021.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/ebay003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

<span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/under003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span>

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Here is a short video of the car in motion -

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

<span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span></span>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Sunday, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and on Lee Talbot (who flew down for the show).

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

</span><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics214.jpg"" alt="""" /></span><span style=""font-size: large;"">

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

</span><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></span><span style=""font-size: large;"">

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

</span><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></span><span style=""font-size: large;"">

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

</span><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics036.jpg"" alt="""" /></span><span style=""font-size: large;"">

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

</span><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics209.jpg"" alt="""" /></span><span style=""font-size: large;"">

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Interior</span></strong>

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

</span><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics017.jpg"" alt="""" /></span><span style=""font-size: large;"">

The stainless steel strips in the bed carry through to the package shelf in the interior.

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.

</span><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/ebay003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span><span style=""font-size: large;"">

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

</span><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span><span style=""font-size: large;"">

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

</span><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></span><span style=""font-size: large;"">

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

</span><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg"" alt="""" /></span><span style=""font-size: large;"">

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

</span><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/under003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span><span style=""font-size: large;"">

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Here is a short video of the car in motion -

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

</span></span></span><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;"">

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

</span></span></span><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;"">

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

</span></span></span><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/kart014.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;"">

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Here is a short video of the car in motion -

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

<span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>
The restoration of this car is fully documented on my blog here -

<span style=""font-size: large;""><strong><a href=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us"">StudeUte Blog</a></span></strong></span></span></span></span>

Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/kart014.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span>

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Sunday, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and on Lee Talbot (who flew down for the show).

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics036.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics209.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics017.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The stainless steel strips in the bed carry through to the package shelf in the interior.

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/under003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Here is a short video of the car in motion -

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Sunday, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and on Lee Talbot (who flew down for the show).

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics036.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics209.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Interior</span></strong>

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics017.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The stainless steel strips in the bed carry through to the package shelf in the interior.

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/ebay003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Here is a short video of the car in motion -

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/kart014.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

The restoration of this car is fully documented on my blog here -

<a href=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us"">StudeUte Blog</a></span></strong></span></span></span></span>

Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Here is a short video of the car in motion -

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Here is a short video of the car in motion -

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/kart014.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

</span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;"">

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

</span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;"">

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

</span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;"">

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

</span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;"">

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Sunday, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and on Lee Talbot (who flew down for the show).

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics209.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/under003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Here is a short video of the car in motion -

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span>

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span>

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Sunday, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and on Lee Talbot (who flew down for the show).

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics181.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span>

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics214.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics209.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Interior</span></strong>

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

The stainless steel strips in the bed carry through to the package shelf in the interior.

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span>

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/under003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span>

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Here is a short video of the car in motion -

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span></span></span>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span></span></span>

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/kart014.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""></span></span></span>

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Sunday, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and on Lee Talbot (who flew down for the show).

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics214.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics036.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics209.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Interior</span></strong>

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics017.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The stainless steel strips in the bed carry through to the package shelf in the interior.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics021.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/ebay003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/under003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Here is a short video of the car in motion -

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/kart014.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

The restoration of this car is fully documented on my blog here -

<a href=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us"">StudeUte Blog</a></span></strong></span></span></span></span>

Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Here is a short video of the car in motion -

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

The restoration of this car is fully documented on my blog here -

<span style=""font-size: large;""><strong><a href=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us"">StudeUte Blog</a></span></strong></span></span></span></span></center>

</strong>Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

<span style=""font-size: large;""><strong></strong><strong>
The restoration of this car is fully documented on my blog here -</strong></span>

<span style=""font-size: large;""><strong><strong><a href=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us"">StudeUte Blog</a></strong></strong></span>
<strong></strong>Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics10.jpg"" alt="""" /> <img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics14.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Sunday, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and on Lee Talbot (who flew down for the show).

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics181.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics214.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics036.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics209.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Interior</span></strong>

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics023.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics017.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

The stainless steel strips in the bed carry through to the package shelf in the interior.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics021.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/ebay003.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/under003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Here is a short video of the car in motion -

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites Vintage Karts and Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Sunday, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and on Lee Talbot (who flew down for the show).

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics214.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics036.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics209.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics017.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The stainless steel strips in the bed carry through to the package shelf in the interior.

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/ebay003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/under003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Here is a short video of the car in motion -

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Here is a short video of the car in motion -

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

<span style=""font-size: large;""><strong></strong><strong><center>
The restoration of this car is fully documented on my blog here -</strong></span>

<span style=""font-size: large;""><strong><a href=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us"">StudeUte Blog</a></strong></span></center>

Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics209.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Sunday, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and on Lee Talbot (who flew down for the show).

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics036.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics209.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics017.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The stainless steel strips in the bed carry through to the package shelf in the interior.

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/ebay003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/under003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Here is a short video of the car in motion -

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/kart014.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

Here is a short video of the car in motion -

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/kart014.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites <a href=""http://www.vintagekarts.com""></a>Vintage Karts and <a href=""http://www.vintagepowersport.com/vka""></a>Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!

<span style=""font-size: large;""><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>
The restoration of this car is fully documented on my blog here -</strong></span>

<span style=""font-size: large;""><strong><a href=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us"">StudeUte Blog</a></strong></span>

Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics10.jpg"" alt="""" /> <img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics14.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites Vintage Karts and Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics10.jpg"" alt="""" /> <img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics14.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Sunday, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and on Lee Talbot (who flew down for the show).

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics181.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics214.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics036.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics209.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Interior</span></strong>

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics023.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics017.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

The stainless steel strips in the bed carry through to the package shelf in the interior.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics021.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/ebay003.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/under003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

In December of 2007, I answered a Craigs List ad for a customized Studebaker.  What I found was a 53 Starlight Coupe that had been quite nicely turned into an el Camino or Australian Ute looking pickup. It was in pieces, but the changes to the body were attractive. It looked so right that Studebaker could have possibly made it.

The seller had bought it at a swap meet in Pleasanton, CA, a few years earlier but had done nothing to the car since the purchase. He had been told it was in the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show, was sold soon thereafter, then torn down for a drive train and color change and sat in a garage in the San Francisco Bay Area until being dragged out to the swap meet 40 years later.

It came with a ton of parts which were all carefully wrapped in copies of the 1964 Oakland (California) Tribune newspaper. So far the sellers story was making sense.

A few weeks after I bought the car, Hot Rod Deluxe published their first issue. HRD is a spin off of Hot Rod Magazine and focuses on traditional hot rods and customs. In that issue on page 9 was a photograph of the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show. There smack dab in the middle of the picture was the Studebaker custom I just purchased! This confirmed the rest of the sellers story.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/HRDsmall.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/Untitled-Grayscale-01-1.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics10.jpg"" alt="""" /> <img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics14.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Sunday, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and on Lee Talbot (who flew down for the show).

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics181.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics214.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics036.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics209.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Interior</span></strong>

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics023.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics017.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

The stainless steel strips in the bed carry through to the package shelf in the interior.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics021.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/ebay003.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/under003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">The Kart
</span></strong>

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img class=""aligncenter"" src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span></p>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites Vintage Karts and Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/kart014.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>
The restoration of this car is fully documented on my blog here -</strong></span>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong><a href=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us"">StudeUte Blog</a></strong></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>

Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

I have a buddy that is deep into old car literature. He dug out the program for the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show and there was the car!

I wrote HRD with my findings and they published my letter in the next issue. To my surprise and delight, Lee Talbot, the original builder of the car, saw my letter in the magazine and gave me a call. Lee is now 80 years old, but still into hot rods and drag boats. Lee has built many hot rods and customs over the years, but was excited to see his old Studebaker surface after all these years.

What a pleasure to actually meet face to face with the creator of my new custom! Lee remembered everything about building the car like it was yesterday. He brought along copies of the many vintage pictures he had of the car under construction and finished. I learned a lot and Lee agreed to stay in touch during the restoration.

I also realized that 2009 would be the 50th anniversary of the cars appearance in the Oakland Roadster Show. That show is the longest running indoor car show in the world.  It is now known as the Grand National Roadster show and is held in Pomona, CA, every January.

I emailed the producer of the show and told him about the car and the history of it. I received a return email.  They wanted the car at their 2009 show. They were planning a special building to recreate an early Roadster Show. My car was EXACTLY what they were looking for. They would waive all entry fees, pay tow money to get it there, and several other perks if I could make it happen.

I made it happen.  Thanks to some good friends, lots of luck, and plenty of long hours the custom rolled off the trailer in Pomona on the Wednesday night prior to the show.  This was the 60th anniversary of the GNRS and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 show in which the Kart Hauler first appeared.  Building #9 at the Los Angeles County Fairplex was decked out to emulate the 1959 show in Oakland so visitors could experience how the old armory-style car shows looked in felt.  The Kart Hauler was in good company.  Also present were Ala Kart, TV Tommy Ivos Buick powered bucket T, the Glass Slipper, the Sam Barris Mercury, Big Daddy Roths Outlaw, Blackie Gejelans 1955 AMBR winner, Tex Smiths XR-6, and Bill Neikamps 1929 roadster that won the first AMBR trophy in 1950 - and a host of others.

On Sunday, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and on Lee Talbot (who flew down for the show).

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics181.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

On Monday, I took the car to Bobby Waltons Speed Shop in Pomona for a photo shoot for the Hot Rod Deluxe feature on the car.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics214.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Body, Paint and Chassis</span></strong>

Lee Talbot started with a 5 year old Studebaker Starlight Coupe (C Model) in 1958.  Lee has a rare combination of artistic talent and technical skills.  His design for this custom is spot on.  Studebaker truly could have made this car (and maybe they should have).  His execution of the design into reality is professional even by todays standards.  Little if any filler was used.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics026.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

When I bought the car it was absolutely rust free and relatively straight.  It had not seen hard use since Lee customized it and clearly had been in dry storage in California since 1964 (or earlier).  The body was made laser straight and the 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green was applied.  The paint is DuPont Centari single stage.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/cad039.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

All the chrome was redone to a show chrome finish.  The stainless was polished.  The undercarriage was cleaned to bare metal and detailed.  The fuel tank, rear end cover plate, and brake cylinder splash guard are black base/clear.  The rest of the undercarriage is satin black.  Mostly new fasteners were used.  All latches, hinges, and reused special fasteners, etc. were cadmium plated.  Any worn parts in the running gear were replaced with new.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics036.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

Tires are new Coker wide whites.  Wheels are stock Studebaker in front and Chrysler rear.  Hubcaps are 1955 Plymouth - just what Lee had on the car in 1959.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics209.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Interior</span></strong>

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics023.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

I had SMS Auto Fabrics custom make the Chippewa Green and Cream vinyl to perfectly match the paint.  Howdy Ledbetter (Hot Rod Hall of Fame upholsterer) stitched up a fantastic period perfect interior using the supplied custom vinyl and high end Mercedes wool carpet.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics017.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

The stainless steel strips in the bed carry through to the package shelf in the interior.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics021.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

The dash is stock 53 Studebaker except for the vintage Stewart Warner tach which replaces the clock.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/ebay003.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

<strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">Engine and Drive Train</span></strong>

The engine is a 1955 Studebaker President 259 cubic inch V8.  Lee Talbot had originally used a Studebaker motor in the car when he built it in 1958, and although it came to me without a drive train, I figured I needed to do the same as Lee.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics007.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The engine is equipped with a vintage Stu-V intake.   Stu-V was a California company that made speed parts for Studebakers in the 1950s.  The unique thing about these manifolds is that they mounted the period correct Stromberg WW carburetors with the 90 degree air horns SIDEWAYS.  They were the only after market intakes that did so.  The advantage was that you could then easily run air cleaners on both carburetors.  With the carbs mounted front to rear like the other makers, there was not enough room for an air cleaner on the front carb.  The throttle linkage to accommodate the sideways mounted carbs is creative to say the least.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><em><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics009.jpg"" alt="""" /></em></span></span>

The air cleaners are cast aluminum reproduction Edmunds units.  The valve covers and valley cover are Offenhauser finned aluminum.  The oil fill tube is polished aluminum.  A late model 5 quart oil pan was installed.  Im using a reproduction Fenton fuel block to distribute the fuel to the dual carbs, and classic red transparent fuel hoses.  It has a stock mechanical fuel pump.  Like all Studebaker engines, this one does mark its territory with a few oil drips.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics011.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The transmission is a Borg Warner T86 three speed with overdrive.  I had this one converted to a floor shifter using a Jeep top shift assembly.  Real hot rods have floor shifts and this was a common way to accomplish that back in the day.  The trany got new bearings, bushings, and gaskets.  The synchros were perfect.  The OD works nicely.  The clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing are new.  The shift knob is custom hand made glass done in the interior colors.

The rear end is a stock Studebaker Dana 44 with a 4.27/1 gear set.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/under003.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span>

The car runs, drives and stops quite nicely, but it has been a show car since I finished it 6 months ago and I do not have many miles on it.  If you intend to drive this car a lot (and that is fine with me if you do), there is most likely additional sorting out to do.  I know, for example, that the carbs are probably too rich right now.  There will be other things that will need tweeking as you get miles on the car.

<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">The Kart
</span></strong>

In the late 50s, the Go Kart craze was catching fire - and for a good reason.  Here was inexpensive, exciting, wheel to wheel racing that anyone and everyone could participate in.  Kart manufacturers and Go Kart tracks were popping up everywhere - coast to coast.  Most major car magazines had a good portion of each issue devoted to Karting and Kart advertisers.

Lee Talbot was not only into hot rod and custom cars, but also designed and built inboard drag boats, AND constructed and raced Go Karts.  He exhibited his customized Studebaker at the 1959 Oakland Roadster Show with a twin engine Go Kart in the bed.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img class=""aligncenter"" src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/oldpics8.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span></p>

Vintage Go Kart racing is currently undergoing a renaissance as baby boomers retire and latch on to those activities they lusted after in their youth.  There are at least two very active vintage go Kart web sites Vintage Karts and Vintage Karting Association with forums, meet schedules, parts vendors, and classifieds.

Since Lee had done it, I thought I would too and began looking for a vintage Kart during the summer of 2008 to display with the car.  I found what I wanted in Idaho.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics270.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

There is such a big demand for vintage Karts today that a couple of the more popular chassis are now being reproduced on the original jigs.  Mine is one of those.  It is a Rupp Dart A Bone now being re-made by ROBRON, Inc in South Carolina.  It is true in every detail to the original late 1950s-early 1960s Kart.

It is running twin vintage West Bend 820s with PVL electronic ignition, Tillotson carbs and GEM box mufflers.  The motors have been gone through and hopped up by Dave Bonbright, the recognized guru of West Bend engines.  They will spin to 13,000 RPMs.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/pics273.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

Clutches are MaxTorque Draggin Skin and engage at 5,000 RPM.

It is running a single Airheart 150 hydraulic brake.

Front tires are ChengShin 3.00 x 3.40 and rears are Carlisle SuperSlicks 11 x 6.

When I purchased the Kart, it only had a few hot laps on it, but was essentially race ready.  I took it completely apart, cleaned and detailed all the mechanicals, and painted the frame with a gold base coat/clear coat automotive paint to match the engine of the Kart Hauler.

<span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: xx-large;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><img src=""http://i706.photobucket.com/albums/ww63/dstnkmp/Ute%20eBay/kart014.jpg"" alt="""" /></span></span></span></span>

I have to admit that it got as much attention at the show as the Kart Hauler did!
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>
The restoration of this car is fully documented on my blog here -</strong></span>

<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>

Also on this site, under <strong>Blogroll</strong>, are hundreds of other pictures of the car under construction and finished, and a complete set of the historic pictures that Lee Talbot gave to me.

This is a pretty special car.   A 50s custom that is actually good looking by todays standards.  Full documentation and history.  Impeccable, fresh, quality restoration.  It would be tough to find another with this combination.  In addition, it would be impossible to duplicate this car for the selling price.

Im a car guy.  I like all cars - new/old - stock/custom - but I tend to specialize in Studebakers.  I like to find them, restore them, show them, and drive them.  That whole process stops if I keep them.  I dont have enough room or enough money to have a collection; so unfortunately, Im selling the Kart Hauler.

It is a <strong>Show Car</strong>.   No disappointments no excuses.  Ive had other cars in the Grand National Roadster Show and featured in major magazines.  My cars have won major national awards.  I have high standards.  Often, pictures flatter a car.  This one is the opposite.  The pictures do not do the car justice.  You have to see it in person to appreciate the fit and finish and attention to detail.  Right down to the little things like the NOS 56 California plate with a 59 sticker - just like the car wore at the 59 Oakland Roadster Show.

Just by accident, I met the son a few years ago. Great guy. He gave me tons of pictures of the house over the years and even the original paperwork when his parents purchased it ($20 a month for 10 years).

These pictures were in those he gave me. It's him and his ""new"" custom he had just purchased in California. It was 1958...

</span></span>The Ute went to the GNRS not running. I just flat ran out of time prior to the show.

A couple of weeks ago, I started into wiring it, getting it running, and working out some bugs. The biggest issue was that dummy me had put the clutch disc in backwards <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_sad.gif"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" border=""0"" />. A real rookie mistake.

It is now running good enough and driving good enough that Brian Curtis and I took it out for a photo shoot in several different locations.

Here's a short video...

Here's a few of what I took. Brian is the REAL photographer and his will be much better than these. Also, my batteries died before we got to the harbor, and the venues there looked real good to my untrained eye. I'm anxious to see Brian's pictures.

It was a FANTASTIC 5 days for a car guy. My only regret is that I didn't get to meet everyone from the SDC Forum that attended the show and didn't get to spend enough time with those I was fortunate enough to bump into.

I'd have to say that the Ute was well received. It was quite an honor to be staged alongside such milestone cars as Ala Kart, the Sam Barris Mercury, the Glass Slipper, Blackie's 1955 AMBR winning roadster, Roth's Outlaw, Tommy Ivo's nailhead powered roadster, and a host of other cars I only dreamed of SEEING in person...let alone PARKED NEXT TO. The Ute drew as big or bigger crowds than any of the above.

I got to the FairPlex Wednesday afternoon, dropped the trailer and picked up Brian Curtis (TW Custom and Modified Editor) at the airport. Brian and I unloaded the car and found our assigned slot. I don't think I was much help. I mainly just stood there with my mouth open checking out the top hot rods and customs from the 50's that surrounded the Ute...

Thursday morning, I picked Jon up at the airport and got him and Brian busy detailing the car while I did ""important"" stuff...

...and spent the rest of the day looking at the 600 or so BEAUTIFUL cars there. Oddly enough there was only one other Studebaker...a modified Avanti. There were a few more that showed up for the outdoor show on Saturday and Sunday, however.

There were a couple of very nice Studebaker powered cars, however. This one won the Jalopy Journal award as voted on by the members of the H.A.M.B. forum. It was one of my favorites too...

One of the high points was getting to spend some time with Lee Talbot...the original builder of the car in 1958. Lee is just fun to be around. He's got more energy, more car stories, more smiles, than I'll EVER have. He was there with car buddes and his son, daughter, and the grandson that has Lee's hot rod '29 Ford that Lee built in the 40's. On Sunday, Hot Rod Deluxe wanted to interview Lee and take some pictures of him with the car. Just about the time we were finishing that process, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and the story...

Sunday night is generally a gong show as 600 cars try to get into their trailers at the same time. Jerry Pitt arranged for a special staging area for our trailer behind the NHRA museum which made the process easier for us. Monday AM, I met Jerry and the photographer at his hotel and followed them to Bobby Walden's Speed Shop where the pictures would be taken. BTW, the photographer was Wes Allison who is one of today's most famous automobile photographers. There probably is not an issue of any major car magazine that doesn't have some of Wes' pictures in it. Wes also works for the major car companies. He is on his way to Detroit today to do a shoot of a concept car for GM. Great guy. Here's few pictures from the shoot...

Wes explained to me that the background is interesting, but ""busy"". For the magazine, he will change the background to black and white so the car stands out in color. Here's a shot I took right after he took the same one.

<a href=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/IMG_2374.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-336"" src=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/IMG_2374-600x450.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""450"" /></a>

Coincidentally, Robert Iannello from <a href=""http://www.benchrace.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">www.benchrace.com</a> was at Bobby's shop when we pulled in. He had been trying to find me at the GNRS to get permission to also shoot the car. Generally, car magazines want an exclusive. For example, Rod and Custom also wanted to shoot the Ute (thanks to Kevin from the SDC forum, but I had to turn them down since HRD has been so good to me from the start. Rod and Custom and HRD BOTH ran Orbitron this month and they were not very happy about it. Anyway, Jerry didn't feel that benchrace was direct competition and felt it was OK.

After the 3 hour shoot at Bobby's place, Robert and I took the car into the industrial part of Pomona and took some more pictures. They will look something like this on benchrace...

I got out of Pomona about 3 PM...over the snow covered grapevine just out of LA, hooked up with Mr. Biggs for a few minutes (too few), and back to San Jose about midnight.

A great car experience for sure! Thanks to all on the SDC Forum that helped make it so. I took over 300 pictures, so I'm sure to bore the group with more when I get home and have some time.";"GNRS";0;"";"inherit";"closed";"closed";"";"232-revision-v1";"";"";"2017-11-26 13:36:53";"2017-11-26 21:36:53";"";232;"http://studeute.steinkamp.us/2017/11/26/232-revision-v1/";0;"revision";"";0

I'd have to say that the Ute was well received. It was quite an honor to be staged alongside such milestone cars as Ala Kart, the Sam Barris Mercury, the Glass Slipper, Blackie's 1955 AMBR winning roadster, Roth's Outlaw, Tommy Ivo's nailhead powered roadster, and a host of other cars I only dreamed of SEEING in person...let alone PARKED NEXT TO.

I got to the FairPlex Wednesday afternoon, dropped the trailer and picked up Brian Curtis (TW Custom and Modified Editor) at the airport. Brian and I unloaded the car and found our assigned slot.

One of the high points was getting to spend some time with Lee Talbot...the original builder of the car in 1958. Lee is just fun to be around.

He was there with car buddes and his son, daughter, and the grandson that has Lee's hot rod '29 Ford that Lee built in the 40's.

Sunday night is generally a gong show as 600 cars try to get into their trailers at the same time. Jerry Pitt arranged for a special staging area for our trailer behind the NHRA museum which made the process easier for us. Monday AM, I met Jerry and the photographer at his hotel and followed them to Bobby Walden's Speed Shop where the pictures would be taken. BTW, the photographer was Wes Allison who is one of today's most famous automobile photographers. There probably is not an issue of any major car magazine that doesn't have some of Wes' pictures in it. Wes also works for the major car companies. He is on his way to Detroit today to do a shoot of a concept car for GM. Great guy. Here's few pictures from the shoot...

Wes explained to me that the background is interesting, but ""busy"". For the magazine, he will change the background to black and white so the car stands out in color. Here's a shot I took right after he took the same one.

Coincidentally, Robert Iannello from <a href=""http://www.benchrace.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">www.benchrace.com</a> was at Bobby's shop when we pulled in. He had been trying to find me at the GNRS to get permission to also shoot the car. Generally, car magazines want an exclusive. For example, Rod and Custom also wanted to shoot the Ute (thanks to Kevin from the SDC forum, but I had to turn them down since HRD has been so good to me from the start. Rod and Custom and HRD BOTH ran Orbitron this month and they were not very happy about it. Anyway, Jerry didn't feel that benchrace was direct competition and felt it was OK.

After the 3 hour shoot at Bobby's place, Robert and I took the car into the industrial part of Pomona and took some more pictures. They will look something like this on benchrace...

A great car experience for sure! Thanks to all on the SDC Forum that helped make it so.

It was a FANTASTIC 5 days for a car guy. My only regret is that I didn't get to meet everyone from the SDC Forum that attended the show and didn't get to spend enough time with those I was fortunate enough to bump into.

I'd have to say that the Ute was well received. It was quite an honor to be staged alongside such milestone cars as Ala Kart, the Sam Barris Mercury, the Glass Slipper, Blackie's 1955 AMBR winning roadster, Roth's Outlaw, Tommy Ivo's nailhead powered roadster, and a host of other cars I only dreamed of SEEING in person...let alone PARKED NEXT TO.

I'd have to say that the Ute was well received. It was quite an honor to be staged alongside such milestone cars as Ala Kart, the Sam Barris Mercury, the Glass Slipper, Blackie's 1955 AMBR winning roadster, Roth's Outlaw, Tommy Ivo's nailhead powered roadster, and a host of other cars I only dreamed of SEEING in person...let alone PARKED NEXT TO. The Ute drew as big or bigger crowds than any of the above.

I got to the FairPlex Wednesday afternoon, dropped the trailer and picked up Brian Curtis (TW Custom and Modified Editor) at the airport. Brian and I unloaded the car and found our assigned slot. I don't think I was much help. I mainly just stood there with my mouth open checking out the top hot rods and customs from the 50's that surrounded the Ute...

...and spent the rest of the day looking at the 600 or so BEAUTIFUL cars there. Oddly enough there was only one other Studebaker...a modified Avanti. There were a few more that showed up for the outdoor show on Saturday and Sunday, however.

There were a couple of very nice Studebaker powered cars, however. This one won the Jalopy Journal award as voted on by the members of the H.A.M.B. forum. It was one of my favorites too...

One of the high points was getting to spend some time with Lee Talbot...the original builder of the car in 1958. Lee is just fun to be around <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile.gif"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" border=""0"" />. He's got more energy, more car stories, more smiles, than I'll EVER have. He was there with car buddes and his son, daughter, and the grandson that has Lee's hot rod '29 Ford that Lee built in the 40's. On Sunday, Hot Rod Deluxe wanted to interview Lee and take some pictures of him with the car. Just about the time we were finishing that process, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and the story...

That's Lee and me on the right and Jerry Pitt, editor of Hot Rod Deluxe doing the talking.

Here's another shot...

<a href=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/IMG_2350.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-332"" src=""http://studeute.steinkamp.us/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/IMG_2350-600x450.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""450"" /></a>

Sunday night is generally a gong show as 600 cars try to get into their trailers at the same time <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_shock.gif"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" border=""0"" />. Jerry Pitt arranged for a special staging area for our trailer behind the NHRA museum which made the process easier for us. Monday AM, I met Jerry and the photographer at his hotel and followed them to Bobby Walden's Speed Shop where the pictures would be taken. BTW, the photographer was Wes Allison who is one of today's most famous automobile photographers. There probably is not an issue of any major car magazine that doesn't have some of Wes' pictures in it. Wes also works for the major car companies. He is on his way to Detroit today to do a shoot of a concept car for GM. Great guy <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_approve.gif"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" border=""0"" />. Here's few pictures from the shoot...

Wes explained to me that the background is interesting, but ""busy"". For the magazine, he will change the background to black and white so the car stands out in color. Here's a shot I took right after he took the same one.

Coincidentally, Robert Iannello from <a href=""http://www.benchrace.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">www.benchrace.com</a> was at Bobby's shop when we pulled in. He had been trying to find me at the GNRS to get permission to also shoot the car. Generally, car magazines want an exclusive. For example, Rod and Custom also wanted to shoot the Ute (thanks to Kevin from the SDC forum <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_approve.gif"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" border=""0"" />), but I had to turn them down since HRD has been so good to me from the start. Rod and Custom and HRD BOTH ran Orbitron this month and they were not very happy about it <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_sad.gif"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" border=""0"" />. Anyway, Jerry didn't feel that benchrace was direct competition and felt it was OK.

After the 3 hour shoot at Bobby's place, Robert and I took the car into the industrial part of Pomona and took some more pictures. They will look something like this on benchrace...

He is on his way to Detroit today to do a shoot of a concept car for GM. Great guy <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_approve.gif"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" border=""0"" />. Here's few pictures from the shoot...

Wes explained to me that the background is interesting, but ""busy"". For the magazine, he will change the background to black and white so the car stands out in color. Here's a shot I took right after he took the same one.

Coincidentally, Robert Iannello from <a href=""http://www.benchrace.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">www.benchrace.com</a> was at Bobby's shop when we pulled in. He had been trying to find me at the GNRS to get permission to also shoot the car. Generally, car magazines want an exclusive. For example, Rod and Custom also wanted to shoot the Ute (thanks to Kevin from the SDC forum <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_approve.gif"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" border=""0"" />), but I had to turn them down since HRD has been so good to me from the start. Rod and Custom and HRD BOTH ran Orbitron this month and they were not very happy about it <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_sad.gif"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" border=""0"" />. Anyway, Jerry didn't feel that benchrace was direct competition and felt it was OK.

After the 3 hour shoot at Bobby's place, Robert and I took the car into the industrial part of Pomona and took some more pictures. They will look something like this on benchrace...

I got out of Pomona about 3 PM...over the snow covered grapevine just out of LA <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_shock.gif"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" border=""0"" />, hooked up with Mr. Biggs for a few minutes (too few), and back to San Jose about midnight.

A great car experience for sure! Thanks to all on the SDC Forum that helped make it so.

My only regret is that I didn't get to meet everyone from the SDC Forum that attended the show and didn't get to spend enough time with those I was fortunate enough to bump into.

I'd have to say that the Ute was well received. It was quite an honor to be staged alongside such milestone cars as Ala Kart, the Sam Barris Mercury, the Glass Slipper, Blackie's 1955 AMBR winning roadster, Roth's Outlaw, Tommy Ivo's nailhead powered roadster, and a host of other cars I only dreamed of SEEING in person...let alone PARKED NEXT TO <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_cool.gif"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" border=""0"" />. The Ute drew as big or bigger crowds than any of the above.

I got to the FairPlex Wednesday afternoon, dropped the trailer and picked up Brian Curtis (TW Custom and Modified Editor) at the airport. Brian and I unloaded the car and found our assigned slot. I don't think I was much help. I mainly just stood there with my mouth open checking out the top hot rods and customs from the 50's that surrounded the Ute...

...and spent the rest of the day looking at the 600 or so BEAUTIFUL cars there. Oddly enough there was only one other Studebaker...a modified Avanti. There were a few more that showed up for the outdoor show on Saturday and Sunday, however.

There were a couple of very nice Studebaker powered cars, however. This one won the Jalopy Journal award as voted on by the members of the H.A.M.B. forum. It was one of my favorites too...

The Cad powered, dark blue Model A coupe that was featured in Rod and Custom several months back was there. The Cad motor in this car was the inspiration for how we ended up doing the motor in the Ute...

One of the high points was getting to spend some time with Lee Talbot...the original builder of the car in 1958. Lee is just fun to be around <img src=""http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile.gif"" alt="""" width=""15"" height=""15"" align=""middle"" border=""0"" />. He's got more energy, more car stories, more smiles, than I'll EVER have. He was there with car buddes and his son, daughter, and the grandson that has Lee's hot rod '29 Ford that Lee built in the 40's. On Sunday, Hot Rod Deluxe wanted to interview Lee and take some pictures of him with the car. Just about the time we were finishing that process, Hot Rod Television showed up and did a short feature on the car and the story...

Jerry Pitt arranged for a special staging area for our trailer behind the NHRA museum which made the process easier for us. Monday AM, I met Jerry and the photographer at his hotel and followed them to Bobby Walden's Speed Shop where the pictures would be taken.

It is frickin PERFECT. If you looked up ""show chrome"" in the dictionary, Jerry's work would be there.

I also received the following from the GNRS along with a note that they have ripped up my check for the entry fees...

<em><strong>
Dear Twice in a Lifetime invitee,</strong></em>

Your vehicle has been specially chosen to join an elite gathering of vehicles celebrating the 60th Anniversary of the Grand National Roadster Show. Twice in a Lifetime will take us all back in history to the classic roadster show with a recreation of the old GNRS buildings highlighted by vehicles from the 1950s to the 2000s.

We will showcase award winning hot rods, customs, bikes, trucks and classics that will offer a unique look at the transition of show vehicle trends over the decades. We think your vehicle best represents the look and style that we want to showcase at this years Grand National Roadster Show.

As one of the 60 invited vehicle owners you will be our guest for the weekend. You will receive Show credentials (2 set up day passes, 2 three day passes, and a weekend parking pass and the show gift package), a commemorative commissioned Dave Bell 60th anniversary poster, and a one of a kind Suede Jacket with the 60th Anniversary Logo embroidered on the back (see logo above) and your name and the first year in the GNRS embroidered on it.

I thought I had rounded up all the clutch linkage parts, but ran into two problems.

The trans is not drilled and tapped for the bolts that would either mount the trans in a car that didn't mount off the bell housing, or (for our Studes) would mount the bracket that holds the clutch operating cross shaft. I've not seen one like this, but there must have been SOME Studebaker application that did not need these holes drilled and tapped



I figured I would drill and tap those holes once the engine and trans were installed so I could mock up the clutch linkage in position to insure I got the holes in the right location.

The second problem is that the bracket that bolts to the trans and holds the cross shaft is too short from where it bolts to the trans to where the ball socket for the cross shaft fits into it. I'm guessing I got one for a sedan and need one for a C/K...

Bottom line is that I need the correct cross shaft bracket (I BELIEVE that is all I need, but I've been wrong before...three times already today)

I couldn't help kind of setting it together. The carbs are old ones (the ones going on it are apart at this point). The oil pan will be replaced with a later style one I have that is also freshly gold painted. The intake needs to be shined up a little. I love the old skool Edmunds air cleaners.

The car is at that stage where the shiny, as shot paint, has been sanded (1500) and looks like H E double hockey sticks. I will go over it again with 2000, then buff...

It's a little strange that BOTH were twisted since the car has an open rear end (factory 4.56/1).

Although Lee had a Supercharged Golden Hawk engine in the car, I don't think it would have done this kind of damage to the axles. When I got the car, it had indications that a brand x engine was installed sometime after Lee sold it. It must have been a little TOO big OR someone had sidestepped the clutch at 4,000 RPMs too often.

I've got one good extra 44 axle in inventory, but need another. Anybody near this corner of the US have an extra?<span id=""msg"" class=""spnMessageText""></span>

Actually it is 1953 Studebaker Chippewa Green. Same as the lower color on Jeff H's beautiful '53...



The interior will be cream and the Chippewa Green vinyl done in a 50's style.

I know the seafoam green got other thumbs down and that it is not EVERYBODY'S favorite, but it just kept coming back to me.

What a great guy! Friendly, sincere, interesting, lively. He's been a ""gear head"" since the early 40's when he built his first hot rod...a '28 Ford roadster with a Riley 4 port head. He bought that car back 20 years ago and still has it. Lee has built many many customs and hot rods. He is one of those few people with artistic talent and fabrication skills. He has also raced cars at Bonneville and the dry lakes and been heavily involved in boat racing. He still campaigns a 392 Chrysler powered flat bottom drag boat.

Just received this from the Producer of the Grand National Roadster Show...

<em>""Hi Dick,</em>

I have a neat surprise for you.

I am working on the 60th Anniversary currently, and we are going to attempt to recreate the building that your car was in back in 59!

I would love to see you and the car there. The plan is to have 10 50�s cars from the show in the front of the building and then timeline back to current in the back of the building.

We are going to recreate the overhead signs as well as try to locate some old standard oil barrels to place around the vehicles.

We will use Bld 9 that we used for the 75th anniversary of the 32 ford 2 years ago.

All of the cars in this room will be historic vehicles and I would love to see you and your Studebaker there.

Please send me you mailing address so I can get you more details.

John Buck ""

Jon Falcon has agreed to do the body and paint for me. He's my young buddy and WyoTech grad that has about 4 years in a restoration shop and did the '63 Hawk for me last year. He's now at Western Washington University here in Bellingham in their Industrial Design program, but has the summer off.

It will have a '55 President 259 with 2 backdraft Stromberg 2 barrels and some Offenhauser aluminum dress up stuff. 3 speed OD with a Jeep floor shifter. (engine and trans courtesy of Gord Richmond)

I need a vintage go Kart for the bed as it was exhibited at the '59 ORS.

It was Pink at the '59 ORS, but I can't do pink. Need some color suggestions.
