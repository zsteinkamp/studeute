Well, at least done ENOUGH for the show.

The engine is all wired and ready to go, but not fired. At this point I don't want to deal with the oil and water leaks I might have, sync'ing the carbs, and burning the paint off the exhaust ports. A drive will have to wait until after the show...Well, maybe until I get home. Hot Rod Deluxe wants to do a photo shoot the Monday following the show in LA.

I leave for my daughter's in San Luis Obispo Sunday and will be in Pomona Wednesday night. They have given the 60 special invited cars permission to unload Wednesday night.

If Brian Curtis' plane into Ontario is on time, I'll do that (I'll need Brian's help.
