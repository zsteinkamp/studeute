I don't check the Studebaker Swap Page as often as I should. BAMS emailed me with a car posted there that he thought I'd be interested in. I'm over inventoried right now, but I checked it out anyway. Right above the ad for that car was some vintage engine dress up parts. I bought the following from that ad....

These will go on the Ute's '55 President motor (thanks Gord!) along with the aluminum 2 x 2 intake with backdraft Stromberg WW's.

2009 will be the 50th anniversary of the Ute's appearance in the National Roadster Show (Oakland Roadster Show). The show is now in Pomona and called the Grand National Roadster Show. I am lobbying to get the Ute into that show this coming February. Good incentive to get it done!<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; color: midnightblue; font-size: x-small;"><span id="msg" class="spnMessageText"> <img src="http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_cool.gif" border="0" alt="" width="15" height="15" align="middle" /></span></span>
