My good friends Tom and Larry picked the Ute up at Howdy's yesterday and brought it to my son's house in San Jose. I'll go down before the show and finish the car there.

Here's a few quick pics...

Howdy saw a little ding in the stainless strip on the left rear quarter and couldn't stand it. He took off the strip and sent it to his stainless guy to be made perfect. The strip is not back on in that last picture.

Here it is going on the trailer at Howdy's and coming off at my son's house...<span id="msg" class="spnMessageText"></span>
