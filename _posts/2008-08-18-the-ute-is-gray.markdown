...well, actually, K36 primer. I'm still up in the air on the final color. Sticking in my mind this week is cream, with blood red and cream interior, red wheels, red engine, red go kart. I'll change my mind a couple more times before I have to make a final selection I'm sure.

All the body work is done. We DP40'd and K36'd it last night. It's nice to have it all one color again. We'll block out the K36, primer it again, block that out, then final paint.

The clubhouse is about 60' long. We tarped off the last 20' or so as a makeshift paint booth. It will work fine for the sealer and primer, but it will go to a pro booth for the color.
