I had the honor of meeting Sam Chakires at the GoodGuys West Coast Nationals in Pleasanton on Friday, August 21st.Â  Sam was Lee Talbot's partner on the original build of the Kart Hauler in 1958.

It was quite a surprise to have Sam walk up and introduce himself to me at the show!

Here's Sam with the car he helped design and build...
