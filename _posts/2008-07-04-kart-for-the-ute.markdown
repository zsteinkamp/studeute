The Ute is looking less and less like a vehicle <img src="http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_sad.gif" border="0" alt="" width="15" height="15" align="middle" />.  It always gets worse before it gets better, but it is currently torn down to nothing.  <img src="http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_shock.gif" border="0" alt="" width="15" height="15" align="middle" />. Pretty much just the body on the chassis sans doors, fenders, etc. as various body pieces get prepped for first primer. I'll post some pics later.

In the meantime, I have been hunting for the right Kart to display in the bed of the Ute at the GNRS as was done 50 years ago at the Oakland Roadster Show.

I found it and bought it today...<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; color: midnightblue; font-size: x-small;"><span id="msg" class="spnMessageText">

</span></span>It's a Dart "A-bone" with two West Bend 820's.  Race ready.

I'll probably end up blowing it apart and painting the chassis the same color as the Ute (WHATEVER that turns out to be <img src="http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile.gif" border="0" alt="" width="15" height="15" align="middle" />)

The downsides are...

They aren't $125 any more like they were back in '59 <img src="http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_sad.gif" border="0" alt="" width="15" height="15" align="middle" />.  It's tough for a CASO to pay more for a Go Kart than I pay for most Studebakers <img src="http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_blackeye.gif" border="0" alt="" width="15" height="15" align="middle" />

Also, I'm liable to get hooked on vintage Kart racing <img src="http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_approve.gif" border="0" alt="" width="15" height="15" align="middle" />.  That's ALL I need...one more hobby <img src="http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_angry.gif" border="0" alt="" width="15" height="15" align="middle" />
