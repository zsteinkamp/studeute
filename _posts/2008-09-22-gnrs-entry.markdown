I just received the Ute's official invitation to the Grand National Roadster Show. Included are some of the things to do that separate the winners from the losers.

<em><strong>Are the tires indexed correctly on the wheel and aligned so that the valve stems are placed at bottom as the vehicles rests on the ground?

Are the tire nibs removed and the tread dressed so you see no factory blemishes?

Is the wiring loomed with wire ties spaced one inch apart?

Are all the fasteners lined up (clocked) and are they of the same type?

Can the judging team touch any part of the vehicle with white gloves and not find any dirt or grease or sooty exhaust? </strong></em>

...and on and on.

I don't think going this far is my cup of tea, but it will be a blast being there with the Studebaker even though there might be some soot in the exhaust pipes <img src="http://forum.studebakerdriversclub.com/images/icon_smile_shock.gif" border="0" alt="" width="15" height="15" align="middle" />.
