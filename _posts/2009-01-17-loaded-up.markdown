<span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; color: midnightblue; font-size: x-small;"><span id="msg" class="spnMessageText">The highpoint of the day was Andy's visit. Great to meet forum members in person...and Andy brought donuts to boot!. Andy cruised down from San Francisco in his beautiful GT with an awesome family history. A VERY special car.</span></span>

Later in the day, my son and I loaded the Ute for the ride to the GNRS. Deb and I leave tomorrow for San Luis Obispo and our youngest daughter's place for a few days.
